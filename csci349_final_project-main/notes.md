k means clustering for the 3 most common colors 

Take 500 randomly sampled pixels from 100 images, compare
Do that again with 

Look again at matplotlib_tutorial for 3d visualization


losing a lot of what makes a monet with separating the RGB values
Need more about style transfer, should do more with SSIM
Take the real photos of the locations and apply the model to the 
Take a blurred version of a photo
Median filtering 
Understand color distribution of the image 
Instead of looking at k means clusters, look at the whole thing
Earth movers distance, a way of computing the distance between two histograms, how much earth you would have to move to change one set of histograms into a nother set of histograms
Use to compare how the blues changed from the original to the transformed images 
Increase the learning rate or inertia 

Make an image 
Pick 100 in the original and in the monetized 
Make a 100 by 100 image, set every 10 by 10 to be one of those colors
