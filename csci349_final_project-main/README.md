## Project
I'm Something of a Painter Myself

## Description
We use a GAN Neural Network trained on images of Monet paintings, to generate over 7000 images that are "Monet-esque". We also collected a series of images of the locations that inspired some of Monet's paintings, then use a VGG19 Neural Network to transform them into the style of Monet. Then we compare these models, and analyze their performance in comparison to Monet paintings using measurements like SSIM and FID.
